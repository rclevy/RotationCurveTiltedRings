# CO data products presented in Cooke, Levy, et al. (2021, in prep.).

The ALMA data used for this study are part of program ADS/JAO.ALMA#2015.1.00820.S (PI L. Blitz) and are publicly available on the [ALMA Science Archive](https://almascience.nrao.edu/asax/).

See Section 2 of Cooke, Levy, et al. (2021, in prep.) for details on the data calibration and imaging. The products presented here are the results of Gaussian fits to the data cube to extract the peak intensity, velocity centroid, and line width (see [Levy et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...860...92L/abstract) for more details).
