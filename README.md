# RotationCurveTiltedRings
Script to fit rotation curves from galaxy velocity fields using tilted rings and a first order harmonic decomposition. Please see examples for use in the code header.

The Python implementation was developed by R. C. Levy (rlevy.astro@gmail.com) and is based on MATLAB scripts by A. D. Bolatto, J. D. Simon, and R. C. Levy.

The Python implementation will be published in a forthcoming paper (Cooke, Levy, Bolatto, et al. 2021, in prep.).

The MATLAB versions of this script were used to derive the rotation curves presented in:
- [Simon et al. 2003](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...596..957S/abstract)
- [Simon et al. 2005](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...621..757S/abstract)
- [Levy et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...860...92L/abstract).
