# RotationCurveTiltedRings
Scripts to fit rotation curves using tilted rings and a first order harmonic decomposition

The Python implementation was developed by R. C. Levy (rlevy@astro.umd.edu) and is based on MATLAB scripts by A. D. Bolatto and R. C. Levy.

The MATLAB versions of these scripts were used to derive the rotation curves presented in Levy et al. 2018: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...860...92L/abstract

Please see examples for use in the code headers.
